/**
 * @short Wrapper for the com_deepin_client_management interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the com_deepin_client_management interface.
 * Its main purpose is to hold the information about one ClientManagement.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create an ClientManagement interface:
 * @code
 * ClientManagement *c = registry->createClientManagement(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the ClientManagement and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * ClientManagement *c = new ClientManagement;
 * c->setup(registry->bindClientManagement(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The ClientManagement can be used as a drop-in replacement for any com_deepin_client_management
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * Please note that all properties of ClientManagement are not valid until the
 * changed signal has been emitted. The wayland server is pushing the
 * information in an async way to the ClientManagement instance. By emitting changed
 * the ClientManagement indicates that all relevant information is available.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.5
